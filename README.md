# Spam SMS Detection

This repository contains a project focused on implementing a solution for detecting spam SMS messages using a Naive Bayes Classifier and Pipelines. The project showcases my efforts in building an effective spam analysis system.

## Project Details

- **Project Type:** Self Project
- **Location:** Rajasthan, India
- **Date:** April 2023

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to develop a spam SMS detection system that effectively identifies spam messages from genuine ones. To achieve this, the project leverages the Naive Bayes Classifier and Pipelines for its implementation.

## Key Achievements

- **High Accuracy:** The trained model achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 96 percent. This remarkable accuracy highlights the model's strength in distinguishing between spam and legitimate SMS messages.
- **Comprehensive Approach:** The project involved a comprehensive approach, covering key stages such as data preparation, feature extraction, and model training. These steps were crucial in ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the final model.
- **Naive Bayes Classifier:** The project's core component is the Naive Bayes Classifier, which forms the backbone of the spam detection system. This choice of algorithm is known for its effectiveness in text classification tasks.
- **Pipelines for Efficiency:** The implementation also incorporates the use of pipelines. Pipelines play a crucial role in streamlining the data preprocessing and model training stages, contributing to efficient and organized development.


## Conclusion

The Spam SMS Detection project showcases a successful implementation of a Naive Bayes Classifier-based spam detection system. The high accuracy of 96% achieved and the systematic approach used in the project underline its effectiveness in addressing the problem of spam SMS messages. By sharing this project on GitHub, I hope to contribute to the community's understanding of spam detection techniques and inspire further advancements in this field.
